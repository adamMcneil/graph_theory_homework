CS5200 Homework 3 Graphs\\
Adam McNeil\\
Question 1) \\

Initialize n sets where n is the number of nodes and each set contains one of the nodes.
Then for each edge in the graph there are two possibilities for the connected nodes. \\
1) The nodes are in different sets\\
Then union the two set together and remove the odd sets\\
2) The nodes are in the same set\\
Then there is a cycle in the graph\\
If you run out of edges without finding a cycle there is no cycle in the graph
\digraph[scale=0.5]{questionone}{
    node [shape=circle]
    edge [arrowhead=none]
    subgraph {
        1 -> 2
        1 -> 3
        1 -> 5
        2 -> 4
        3 -> 6
        4 -> 5
    }
}
